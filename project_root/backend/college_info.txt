The role of Artificial Intelligence and Data sciences (AI & DS)
Artificial intelligence is here and being rapidly commercialized, with new applications being created not just for manufacturing but also for energy, healthcare, and oil and gas. This will change how we all do business. ∼Joe Kaeser
Tech advancements place rising importance on both hard and soft skills. While employees must be able to speak the language of data and other hard skills, soft skills are increasingly essential. Judgment calls, creative thinking, and emotional intelligence are in high demand − and not easily replicated by AI. While change can be slow within an organization, experts say that adapting sooner rather than later is key to future success.
Design and develop software application for different industries.
Manages the software, hardware and network in any industry.
Involves in the design and development of the hardware components of PCs & Laptops.
Develop software for peripheral computing device such as printers, modems and scanners
Write codes and algorithms for operating systems like Windows, Linux etc.
